# Unit Test Coverage for InterSystems ObjectScript

Run your typical ObjectScript %UnitTest tests and see which lines of your code are executed. Includes Cobertura-style reporting for use in continuous integration tools.

## Getting Started

A minimum platform version of InterSystems IRIS® data platform 2022.1 is required to run the latest version of TestCoverage.

| InterSystems Platform Version | Compatible TestCoverage Version                                                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IRIS >=2022.1                 | 4.x                                                                                                |

| Caché / Ensemble              | 2.x  (via artifacts available in [Releases](https://github.com/intersystems/TestCoverage/releases))|

### Installation: IPM

If you already have the [InterSystems Package Manager](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/package/InterSystems-Package-Manager-1), installation is as easy as:
```
zpm "install testcoverage"
```

### Installation: of Release

Download an XML file from [Releases](https://github.com/intersystems/TestCoverage/releases), then run:
```
Set releaseFile = "<path on filesystem to xml file>"
Do $System.OBJ.Load(releaseFile,"ck")
```

### Installation: from Terminal

First, clone or download the repository. Then run the following commands:

```
Set root = "<path on filesystem to which repository was cloned/downloaded>"
Do $System.OBJ.ImportDir(root,"*.inc;*.cls","ck",,1)
```

### Security
Note that, depending on your security settings, SQL privileges may be required for access to test coverage data. The relevant permissions may be granted by running:

```
zw ##class(TestCoverage.Utils).GrantSQLReadPermissions("<username or role that should have read permissions>")
```

For example:

```
zw ##class(TestCoverage.Utils).GrantSQLReadPermissions("_PUBLIC")
```

## User Guide

### Running Tests with Coverage
Generally speaking, set `^UnitTestRoot`, and then call `##class(TestCoverage.Manager).RunTest()` the same you would call `##class(%UnitTest.Manager).RunTest()`. For more information on InterSystems' %UnitTest framework, see the [framework overview](https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=GUNITTEST) and/or the [class reference for %UnitTest.Manager](https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/documatic/%25CSP.Documatic.cls?PAGE=CLASS&LIBRARY=%25SYS&CLASSNAME=%25UnitTest.Manager).

The "userparam" argument can be used to pass optional information about code coverage data collection. For example:

```
Set tCoverageParams("CoverageClasses") = <$ListBuild list or %DynamicArray of class names for which code coverage data should be collected>
Set tCoverageParams("CoverageRoutines") = <$ListBuild list or %DynamicArray of routine names for which code coverage data should be collected>
Set tCoverageParams("CoverageDetail") = <0 to track code coverage overall; 1 to track it per test suite (the default); 2 to track it per test class; 3 to track it per test method.>
Set tCoverageParams("ProcessIDs") = <$ListBuild list of process IDs to monitor, or "Interoperability"> 
Set tCoverageParams("Timing") = <1 to capture timing data, 0 to not> 
Set tCoverageParams("PyModules") = <$ListBuild list of Python module names to preload> 
Set tCoverageParams("ListenerManager") = <instance of TestCoverage.Listeners.ListenerManager>) 
Do ##class(TestCoverage.Manager).RunTest(,,.tCoverageParams)
```

The first two arguments to `TestCoverage.Manager:RunTest` are the same as `%UnitTest.Manager`.

At the selected level of granularity (before all tests or a test suite/case/method is run), there will be a search for a file named "coverage.list" within the directory for the test suite and parent directories, stopping at the first such file found. This file may contain a list of classes, packages, and routines for which code coverage will be measured. For .MAC routines only (not classes/packages), the coverage list also supports the * wildcard. It is also possible to exclude classes/packages by prefixing the line with "-". For example, to track coverage for all classes in the `MyApplication` package (except those in the `MyApplication.UI` subpackage), and all routines with names starting with "MyApplication":

```
// Include all application code
MyApplication.PKG
MyApplication*.MAC

// Exclude Zen Pages
-MyApplication.UI.PKG
```

As an alternative approach, with unit test classes that have already been loaded and compiled (and which will not be deleted after running tests) and a known list of classes and routines for which code coverage should be collected, use:

```
Do ##class(TestCoverage.Manager).RunAllTests(tPackage,tLogFile,tCoverageClasses,tCoverageRoutines,tCoverageLevel,.tLogIndex,tSourceNamespace,tProcessIDs,tTiming)
```

Where:

* `tPackage` has the top-level package containing all the unit test classes to run. These must already be loaded.
* `tLogFile` (optional) may specify a file to log all output to.
* `tCoverageClasses` (optional) has a $ListBuild list of class names within which to track code coverage. By default, none are tracked.
* `tCoverageRoutines` (optional) has a $ListBuild list of routine names within which to track code coverage. By default, none are tracked.
* `tCoverageLevel` (optional) is 0 to track code coverage overall; 1 to track it per test suite (the default); 2 to track it per test class; 3 to track it per test method.
* `tLogIndex` (optional) allows for aggregation of code coverage results across unit test runs. To use this, get it back as output from the first test run, then pass it to the next.
* `tSourceNamespace` (optional) specifies the namespace in which classes were compiled, defaulting to the current namespace. This may be required to retrieve some metadata.
* `tPIDList` (optional) has a $ListBuild list of process IDs to monitor. If this is empty, all processes are monitored. If this is $ListBuild("Interop") or "Interoperability", all interoperability processes and the current process are monitored. By default, only the current process is monitored.
* `tTiming` (optional) is 1 to capture execution time data for monitored classes/routines as well, or 0 (the default) to not capture this data.
* `tListenerManager` (optional)  is an instance of TestCoverage.Listeners.ListenerManager that allows downstream applications to listen to the completion of unit test suites/cases/methods. It should use the AddListener method to populate with listeners that extend TestCoverage.Listeners.ListenerInterface. See [isc.perf.ui](https://github.com/intersystems/isc-perf-ui) for an example usage
* `tPyModules` a $ListBuild list of Python module names the covered code uses that should be imported before the unit tests are run. This is for modules like `pandas` and `sklearn`, whose import sometimes breaks sys.settrace 


### Running Tests with Coverage via IPM

Running unit tests with test coverage measurement via IPM is much simpler. Given a package `mycompany.foo`, a coverage.list file within its [unit test resource(s)](https://github.com/intersystems/ipm/wiki/03.-IPM-Manifest-(Module.xml)#unittest-or-test), and TestCoverage installed, tests can be run with coverage with:

```
zpm "mycompany.foo test -only -DUnitTest.ManagerClass=TestCoverage.Manager"
```

Additional "userparam" keys can be passed in the zpm command prefixed with `-DUnitTest.UserParam.` - for example:

```
    zpm "mycompany.foo test -only "_
       "-verbose -DUnitTest.ManagerClass=TestCoverage.Manager -DUnitTest.JUnitOutput=/test-reports/junit.xml "_
       "-DUnitTest.FailuresAreFatal=1 -DUnitTest.Manager=TestCoverage.Manager "_
       "-DUnitTest.UserParam.CoverageReportClass=TestCoverage.Report.Cobertura.ReportGenerator "_
       "-DUnitTest.UserParam.CoverageReportFile=/source/coverage.xml"
```

Note that it is best practice to put your unit tests in a separate directory from your source code, most commonly `/tests`.

For more details and examples, see [this InterSystems Developer Community article series](https://community.intersystems.com/post/unit-tests-and-test-coverage-intersystems-package-manager).

### Viewing Results
After running the tests, a URL is shown in the output at which you can view test coverage results. If the hostname/IP address in this URL is incorrect, you can fix it by changing the "WebServerName" setting in the management portal, at System Administration > Configuration > Additional Settings > Startup.

### Reporting on results in Cobertura format
The `RunTest()` method reports back a log index in the "userparam" argument. This can be used to generate a report in the same format as Cobertura, a popular Java code coverage tool. For example:

```
Set userParams("CoverageDetail") = 0
Do ##class(TestCoverage.Manager).RunTest(,"/nodelete",.userParams)
Set reportFile = "C:\Temp\Reports\"_tUserParams("LogIndex")_"\coverage.xml"
Do ##class(TestCoverage.Report.Cobertura.ReportGenerator).GenerateReport(userParams("LogIndex"),reportFile)
```

This exports both the coverage results themselves and the associated source code (in UDL format) for correlation/display, and has been verified with [the Cobertura plugin for Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin).
